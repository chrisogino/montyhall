\description{
\code{change_door_5_doors()} selects a door based on the strategy in the
params. If the strategy is stay, the contestant keeps the pick
from select_door. If not, they choose a new door that is neither
the door from select_door_5_doors nor open_goat_door_5_doors
}
\details{
The game setup replicates the game on the TV show "Let's
Make a Deal" where there are five doors for a contestant
to choose from, one of which has a car behind it and four
have goats. The contestant selects a door, then the host
opens a door to reveal a goat, and then the contestant is
given an opportunity to stay with their original selection
or switch to the other unopened doors. There was a famous
debate about whether it was optimal to stay or switch when
given the option to switch, so this simulation was created
to test both strategies.
